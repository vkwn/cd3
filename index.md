# CANCER DATA DRIVEN DETECTION (CD3)

[Â£10m funding for new programme to help identify individual cancer risk](https://news.cancerresearchuk.org/2025/01/22/10m-funding-cancer-data-driven-detection-programme/)

## MAIN THEMES

1. Prevent cancer
2. Detect + diagnose cancer early
3. Equity

## WORKSTREAMS

Workstream 1 (WS1): CD3 Cancer Data Lab

Workstream 2 (WS2): Advanced analytics and multi-factorial modelling

### About Workstream 1

Theme 1 = Health system data

Theme 2 = Administrative data

Theme 3 = UK prospective cohorts and international consortia

### About Workstream 2

WS2.1 = Develop methods for missing data, data completeness, drifts, model fairness

WS2.2 = Develop tools for feature identification, data embedding and dataset fusion

WS2.3 = Identify appropriate statistical / AI methodology for multimodal cancer risk prediction

WS2.4 = Develop pipeline for model performance evaluation

## DRIVERS

Driver Programme 1 (DP1) = Develop a comprehensive multi-cancer prediction model for asymptomatic populations that can improve early detection and cancer prevention

Driver Programme 2 (DP2) = To develop dynamic risk prediction models for breast and colorectal cancers, incorporating updateable screening findings, and models for cancer subtypes and precursors, to optimise screening programmes

Driver Programme 3 (DP3) = To develop cancer risk prediction models to guide the use of MCD tests in symptomatic patients, and potentially the use of other tests AND To develop dynamic risk models to inform the diagnostic decision-making, with updateable risk estimates during the diagnostic process (eg, as test results accumulate or symptoms evolve)

## DRIVER PROGRAMME OBJECTIVES

### DP1 Multi cancer risk prediction

1. Use multimodal data and advanced analytics to develop multi-cancer risk prediction models based on known and novel risk factors that are attentive to equity.
2. Assess the clinical utility of the model in selecting individuals for screening and preventive interventions.
3. Model the impact of changes in risk factors (modifiable and non-modifiable) on a population-level to inform public health policy on prevention and early detection across population subgroups.

### DP2 Risk prediction for cancers with screening programmes

1. Develop and validate risk prediction models for breast cancer sub-types 
2. Develop dynamic risk prediction models using screening and other multimodal data 
3. Identify risk factors for advanced adenomas and sessile serrated polyps and their effect on progression to colorectal cancer (CRC)
4. Identify risk-stratified screening strategies that optimise benefit-harm trade-offs of breast and CRC screening programmes 

### DP3 Symptomatic cancer risk stratification 

1. Develop and validate an integrated dynamic risk prediction for different cancers which provides a revised risk when healthcare events occur. 
2. Understand specific issues around missing data for symptomatic risk models and develop novel methods for dealing with such unobserved missing data. 
3. Understand the clinical impact of the use of MCD tests and the dynamic risk prediction model in different scenarios.
